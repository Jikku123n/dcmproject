\section{Conditional Monitoring Sensor}
There are three sensors used for monitoring and evaluation management in the system.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item {We use a voltage transformer to measure the supply voltage as it acts as a step-down and sensing of the supply voltage.}

\subsection{Voltage Transformer}
The voltage transformer is used for measuring high alternating voltage purposes; here in this project, it also acts as a sensor for sensing the supply voltage of an Induction Motor. It is a step-down transformer that converts 230 v to 4 v supply.\\

\subsection{ESP8266}
We use the Wi-Fi module for communication with the cloud. We have used the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to exchange information between devices to the cloud without connecting to any wire. Each device has its I.P address. For connection to the cloud,  the I.P address is entered on the Android application, and the devices in the system, i.e., induction motor, sensors, speed controlling device. 
These are connected to the cloud and send information to the cloud without any wired connection, i.e., through the Wi-Fi module send information for further process.

\section{Method}
3 phase AC supply comes into the system; from AC supply to 3 phase Induction Motor through a speed controlling device and gate driver circuit. Here, the gate driver circuit acts as a logic circuit to on-off the switches to control the motor's speed. There are many methods to control the speed of the motor, but the PWM technique has been used here to control the speed of an induction motor. PWM technique is very sophisticated to use and most sophisticated to operate than any other method. By adjusting the ON-OFF period of TRIAC switches controlling the firing angle and, from that, the firing angle controls the speed of the induction motor.
