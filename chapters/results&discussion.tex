AC voltage of frequency 50hz is fed to the induction motor by converting a DC voltage of 100V and resistive load of 10ohm using a DC-AC inverter.\\ 
The speed of the motor is then controlled by using Pulse Width Modulation techique using a gate driver circuit consisting TRIAC switches. The ON-OFF period of the TRIAC switches are adjusted by signals from the Arduino UNO unit.\\ 
The Arduino UNO unit is provided a 5V DC current provided by a step down transformer with a rectifier and a regulator.\\ 
The speed of the motor is measured with a tachometer and compared with the frequency of the PWM signal generated.\\
