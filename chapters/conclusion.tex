This project represents the impact of IoT is well known and is a rapidly growing technology. Now IoT has become a vital part of human life. Recently IoT has come all over the field such as industry, home automation, electric vehicle, traction, agriculture, medical field, etc., with the help of sensors. This project represents IoT-based condition monitoring parameters and controlling the speed of the motor with the help of the PWM technique. By analyzing the motor parameters, make the motor-operated safe and protective. It also helps in calculating new data to interact with social media and others. In industries require continuous monitoring of data value for power consumption and maintenance applications. If the motor gets over current, speed, and excessive temperature than its rated value, it will automatically disconnect from the supply.\\
